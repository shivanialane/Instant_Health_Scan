# Mini Project Readme File
Title of the Project: Instant Health Scan using ML & DL

# Project Idea:
The problem addressed is the limited access to definitive healthcare outcomes, highlighted by the Covid-19 pandemic. The project proposes a solution by replacing traditional doctor consultations with a faster, more precise disease detection system. This approach integrates machine learning and deep learning techniques to provide a comprehensive and technologically advanced solution for various health concerns.

# Modules in the Project:
1)	Imaging Diagnostics (Alzheimer’s, Brain Tumor, Pneumonia, COVID-19) 
2)	Data-Driven Disease Prediction (Heart, Diabetes, Breast Cancer) <br>
# Imaging Diagnostics (Alzheimer’s, Brain Tumor, Pneumonia, COVID-19):
This module employs cutting-edge image analysis techniques to predict diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Brain Tumor, Pneumonia, and COVID-19. Processing medical images, provides detailed insights into complex conditions, aiding in early detection and precise diagnosis. Whether identifying neural irregularities or recognizing respiratory infections, this module excels in image-centric disease prediction. <br>
# Data-Driven Disease Prediction (Heart, Diabetes, Breast Cancer):
In contrast, Module 2 focuses on diseases such as Heart conditions, Diabetes, and Breast Cancer using numerical data. By aggregating diverse datasets, this module employs predictive modeling and data analysis to discern patterns and forecast the likelihood of these diseases. It emphasizes the importance of numerical values, medical history, and clinical assessments to make informed predictions, contributing to a holistic healthcare approach. Together, these modules form a robust framework for comprehensive health prediction, incorporating both image-based and value-based insights
